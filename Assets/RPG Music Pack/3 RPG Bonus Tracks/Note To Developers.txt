Greetings, fellow creatives!

We at the team of Owl Theory Music thank you heartily for purchasing this music pack. Over the course of several months, we have
searched for the best sounds and our own intuition in order to create the best possible and most inspired pieces of music that we
have ever created. 

We hope you enjoy the pack! I hope you consider leaving a review on the Unity Store so that our music can help more developers and 
impact more lives. If you didn't, or have any questions or concerns about the pack, email me personally at alec.weesner@gmail.com

Within this massive multi-pack, you will find 6 folders for each specific genre, and also 3 bonus tracks. Within each of these 
folders, you will find additional folders for each song. We have created many variations in each song for the best customizable use for
your project. Usually, a single song will have at least 2-3 different versions, each having a "Fade-Out" and a "LOOP" file. There may
also be a "INTRO" and "REVERB TAIL" files:

	() The "Fade-Out" audio file is used primarily for you to know where the different cuts are in the music, so you can easily
		time where to combine both the "INTRO" file (if the song has one) and the "LOOP" file. Most of the time
		though, you'll want to use just the "LOOP" and the "REVERB TAIL" to loop. The "Fade-Out" file
		can also be used as a one-shot, as each song has a dedicated ending.

	() The "LOOP" audio file is usually the beginning of the song (if the song has no "INTRO" file), and should be used first
		if you are planning to loop. Note that sometimes you cannot use this file alone to loop, as the ending may abruptly 
		cut-off. Use both the "LOOP", and "REVERB TAIL" at the end to allow a seamless transition.

	() The "INTRO" is the very beginning of the song, that isn't repeated in a "LOOP" file. See the "How To Loop" Text Document 
		to learn how to loop.

	() The "REVERB TAIL" audio file begins directly when the "LOOP" file finishes. See the "How To Loop" Text Document to learn 
		how to loop.

All audio assets are rendered in WAV at 44.1 Khz and 16Bit.
