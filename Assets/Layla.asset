  - "Hey you, you\u2019re finally awake. Took you long enough. What the hell happened
    to you? You look like an Erasmus student on his first week there. Too much \u201Csocial
    lubricant\u201D in your systems? \r\n"
  - "You didn\u2019t leave last night. You left last week. (*sights*) And while you
    were gone the Emperor\u2019s men took over the village. And it\u2019s up to you
    to take it back. After all, you are the village protector. Now take your \u201CWidowmaker\u201D. 
    Couldn\u2019t think of a better name, could you? \r\n"
  playerDialogue:
  - "Wow, that\u2019s my house. I remember leaving it last night but I have no memory
    of coming here. Where is all my stuff? \r\n"
